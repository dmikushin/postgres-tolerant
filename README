Error-tolerant version of PostgreSQL Database Management System
===============================================================

This is a special version of PostgreSQL database management system,
which is made tolerant to database errors, due to disk errors created
by power outage. Unlike the reference, this version does not give up
in case of a missing attribute or data block corruption, and still tries
to recover as much data as possible and minimize the damages.

Compile and run this version as you would usually do:

    CFLAGS="-O0" ../configure --enable-debug --prefix=(pwd)/../install --with-lz4
    make -j12 && make install
    ../install/bin/postgres -O -P -D (pwd)/../../data/ -c log_error_verbosity=verbose

Now perform the tables content dumping. You may see different warnings,
but the healthy rows will still be retrieved:

    ../install/bin/pg_dump --column-inserts --data-only --table=tblname -U user dbname >../../data/dump.sql

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
